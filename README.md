ANZ Integrations Coding Challenge
==================================

For this coding challenge I used a boilplate to generate my Express API => [https://github.com/developit/express-es6-rest-api](https://github.com/developit/express-es6-rest-api)


# Boiler plate specs
- ES6 support via [babel](https://babeljs.io)
- REST resources as middleware via [resource-router-middleware](https://github.com/developit/resource-router-middleware)
- CORS support via [cors](https://github.com/troygoode/node-cors)
- Body Parsing via [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser)
